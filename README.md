## Election Audit Summary
The script is flexible enough that it could be used for any state as long as the CSV data file was laid out in the same format as the Colorado file. It wouldn't take much effort to be adapt the program to also show the total votes cast and percentage breakdown for the counties. It could be interesting to show which county had the lowest turnout which could illustrate where voter engagement efforts need to be increased.
